# Console-Finances

##### This code is analyzing a set of financial data. It is calculating and outputting various statistics about the data, such as the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of profit or loss over the entire period, the average change in profit or loss over the entire period, the greatest increase in profit over the entire period, and the greatest decrease in loss over the entire period.

## Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.
   
You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
